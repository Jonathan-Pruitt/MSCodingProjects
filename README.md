<p>This is a simple repository for projects assigned by the Mississippi Coding Academy as well as personal projects.
I have been learning programming and development since Mid-March 2023.</p>

<h1>TABLE OF CONTENTS:</h1>
<ul>
  <li><h3>ASCII Image Converter</h3> A .Net WPF application (XAML / C#) that allows for upload of an image, the image is then converted into ASCII symbols and partially viewable through the application. You can export the data as a .txt file to view the whole image in Notepad.</li>

<li><h3>Catan Tracker</h3> A .Net WPF application (XAML / C#) that is meant to be a supplement to the popular board game "Settlers of Catan". My wife and her family love playing Catan, and they like tracking data from the game, so I built this application to assist them.</li>

<li><h3>Forecast</h3> A very simple web application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that displays a web page showing the end-user's 7 Day Forecast (assuming they are using a browser and device that supports location services).</li>

<li><h3>JS Calculator</h3> A simple web application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that hosts an interactive and functional standard calculator.</li>

<li><h3>TicTacToe</h3> A .Net Console application (C#) that hosts a purely console-based 2 player game of TicTacToe. (Requires 2 human players)</li>
</ul>
