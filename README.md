This is a simple repository for projects assigned by the Mississippi Coding Academy as well as personal projects.
I have been learning programming and development since Mid-March 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS:
Catan Tracker -- A .Net WPF application (XAML / C#) that is meant to be a supplement to the popular board game "Settlers of Catan". My wife and her family love playing Catan, and they like tracking data from the game, so I built this application to assist them.
Forecast -- A very simple web application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that displays a web page showing the end-user's 7 Day Forecast (assuming they are using a browser and device that supports location services).
JS Calculator -- A simple web application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that hosts an interactive and functional standard calculator.
TicTacToe -- A .Net Console application (C#) that hosts a purely console-based 2 player game of TicTacToe. (Requires 2 human players)
